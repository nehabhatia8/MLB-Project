# PROJECT TITLE
## Project Description
In this project, we investigate the gut microbiome of IBD patients using unsupervised learning methods. We seek to identify microbial community structures that are associated with IBD, and we use K-Means Clustering, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Clustering, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to explore the data.
